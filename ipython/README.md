iPython
---------

iPython notebooks go here. This does not include pure python code (.py files) .

Uncertain how usage examples will work for iPython notebooks!

### telemetry_plotter.ipynb

This needs to be imported from Ron's repo: https://github.com/ronf-ucb/telemetry

**TODO: Reformat import as an external function (.ipynb or .py) that can be imported into any iPython notebook or python script.** (Ron)
