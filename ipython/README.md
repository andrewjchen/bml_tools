BML Code Tools
===============

iPython
---------

iPython notebooks go here. This does not include pure python code (.py files) .

Uncertain how usage examples will work for iPython notebooks!

telemetry_plotter.ipynb
iPython notebook to read telemetry file from robot, and plot state data, as well as calculated torque/power. 

Usage
	1. In Windows or Linux command shell:
		c:bml_tools\ipython notebook
	2. In web browser, edit file name in cell. Example data is
	provided in example_imudata.txt/ 
	3. Cell -> Run All.
	4. Figures are in .png and can be saved from
	 the web browser.

Note: Telemetry convention is defined at: wiki.eecs.berkeley.edu/biomimetics/Internal/TelemetryData

### telemetry_plotter.ipynb

**TODO: Reformat import as an external function (.ipynb or .py) that can be imported into any iPython notebook or python script.** (Ron)
